  Learning Intention:
  The students understand binary selection logic and apply it to a simple control structures.
  
  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand binary selection is asking questions that only have a true and false outcome
    2.  I can apply different comparison operators to get a desired outcome in a basic if else
        control structure 
    3.  I understand 'if', 'if else', and 'if else if else'
    4.  I understand the difference between a 'nested if', and using boolean operators
    5.  I can read a simple logic flowchart

  Student Notes: 
  Comparison Operators
    - != (not equal to)
    - < (less than)
    - <= (less than or equal to)
    - == (equal to)
    - > (greater than)
    - >= (greater than or equal to)

    Boolean Operators
    - ! (logical not)
    - && (logical and)
    - || (logical or)
