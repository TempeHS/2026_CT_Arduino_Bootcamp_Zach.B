  Learning Intention:
  The students will learn basic math and arithmetic operations in C++

  Success Criteria:
    1.  I know the arithmetic operation symbols %, *, +, -, / & =
    2.  I can perform arithmetic calculations
    3.  I know how to access more information in the documentation about math and arithmetic
    4.  I can access the order of operations documentation and use parenthesis to control
        the order of operations
    5.  I understand short-hand incrementation and decrementation 
    6.  I can seed and generate a random number
    7.  I can map an analogue value on a range of 0-1023 to a PWM value on a range of 0-255

  Student Notes:
    % (remainder)
    * (multiplication)
    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    / (division)
    = (assignment operator)
