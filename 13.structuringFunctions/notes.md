# My System

My system will use the light sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and button, to detect if someone enters a room, and then if the light level is low enough, it will turn the led on to provide light. Pressing the button will trigger the led to turn off again.

## Sensors

| Ultrasonic | Detect if soemone enters | 5 |
